# Yu-Gi-Oh Deck Builder

# Startup
To use this software run it with VScode by opening an integrated terminal, then type "python3 app.py" and search localhost:5000 in your browser or press 'go live' in VScode.

# Usage
Once running, you will need to sign/login to use the create card or create deck route.

I recommend first creating a deck before creating any cards, but the forms tell someone any other necessary information.

# Technologies
Python, HTML
