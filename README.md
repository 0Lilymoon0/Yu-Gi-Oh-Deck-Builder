# Yu-Gi-Oh Deck Builder

All you really need to do to use this is run it with VScode and search localhost:5000 in your browser. 

Once running, you will need to sign/login to use the create card or create deck route.

I reccommend first creating a deck before creating any cards, but the forms tell someone any other neccessary information.
