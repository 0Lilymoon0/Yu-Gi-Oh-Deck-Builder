# Yu-Gi-Oh Deck Builder

## Startup
1. Run with VScode by opening an integrated terminal.
2. Type "python3 app.py."
3. Search localhost:5000 in your browser or press 'go live' in VScode.

## Usage
Once running, you will need to sign/login to use the create card or create deck route.

I recommend first creating a deck before creating any cards, but the forms tell someone any other necessary information.

## Technologies
Python, HTML
